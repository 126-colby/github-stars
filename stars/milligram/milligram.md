> A minimalist CSS framework.

Why it's awesome

Milligram provides a minimal setup of styles for a fast and clean starting point. Just it! **Only 2kb gzipped!** It's not about a UI framework. Specially designed for better performance and higher productivity with fewer properties to reset resulting in cleaner code. Hope you enjoy!
