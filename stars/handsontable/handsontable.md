ðŸ¤” Is Handsontable a Data Grid or a Spreadsheet?
------------------------------------------------

Handsontable is a data grid component written in JavaScript, not a spreadsheet. However, it brings in many features typically found in spreadsheet software. We designed it this way because spreadsheet-like patterns are often the most user-friendly when it comes to data entry and management.

### Spreadsheet-like features in Handsontable:

-   Keyboard shortcuts compliant with either Google Sheets or Excel
-   400 spreadsheet formulas via native integration with HyperFormula
-   Keyboard navigation across headers that can be disabled, making only cells navigable
-   TAB navigation across cells that can be disabled
-   Built-in undo-redo functionality
-   Powerful clipboard capabilities for copy-paste operations
-   Ability to scroll the grid within the container (`div`) or window
-   Data binding in the form of an array of objects or arrays of arrays
-   Built-in cell editors like a date picker or dropdown list

At first glance, it might seem that a data table, spreadsheet, and data grid are just different names for the same thing - an interactive table displaying data. In reality, these tools serve different purposes and offer distinct functionalities, designed to meet specific needs. Handsontable sits comfortably in the data grid category while incorporating many of the best aspects of spreadsheet software.
