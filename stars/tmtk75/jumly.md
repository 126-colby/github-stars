README
======

JUMLY is a JavaScript library.  
Using JUMLY, you can easily embed UML diagram on your HTML document.  
All you need is just two things you use everyday.

-   Text editor you get used to use.
-   A modern browser like WebKit-base brwoser and Opera.  
    (working for Firefox now)

For more information, see http://jumly.tmtk.net/.  
The auther's blog is http://tmtk75.github.com.

Trait and Purpose
-----------------

Trait I'd like to tell you is that JUMLY doesn't render diagram as image like PNG or SVG, but render as **combination of DOM with CSS on browser**. You can easily calibrate any CSS parameters like font-size, color, padding, margin, etc using CSS at runtime.

Actually you can also usual image data in PNG and JPEG. They are generated by a CLI or REST API, so JUMLY is convenient way to embed small diagrams in your HTML documents like README file like below.  

I aim to develop JUMLY to render small UML diagrams in handy without any heavy UML modeling tools. A UML diagram is usually more understandable than a tedious text. It's better that people can casually use UML digrams in every documents.

Getting Started
===============

Copy following code, save as a file, and open the file with your browser.

<head\>
<script src\='http://code.jquery.com/jquery-2.1.0.min.js'\></script\>
<script src\='http://coffeescript.org/extras/coffee-script.js'\></script\>
<script src\='http://jumly.tmtk.net/public/jumly.min.js'\></script\>
</head\>
<body\>
<script type\='text/jumly+sequence'\>
@found "You", \-\>
  @message "meet", "JUMLY"
</script\>
</body\>

Here is a minimal sample.

How to build
============

Requiring node.js v0.10.20 or upper.

node.js installation
--------------------

nvm is good to get it.

```
$ git clone git://github.com/creationix/nvm.git ~/.nvm
$ . ~/.nvm/nvm.sh
$ nvm install 0.10
```

Build jumly
-----------

In order to build jumly.js, jumly.css and minified ones, it's shortly steps.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/tmtk75/jumly.git
$ cd jumly
$ . .env
$ npm install
$ make build
```

`./public/jumly.min.js` is generated.

How to develop
==============

Written in CoffeeScript and stylus. They are in `./lib` directory. `./lib/js/jumly.coffee` organizes other \*.coffee files in order.

On a webapp, which is described at next, you can use them without build. Editing \*.coffee and \*.styl, reload a page of webapp, and your change will make effect.

How to launch the webapp
========================

You can launch the webapp using express.

```
$ . .env
$ git submodule update --init
$ ./app.coffee
```

Please access to localhost:3000 thru your browser.

How to run specs
================

With browser
------------

```
$ make test
```

Compile spec files, and open `./spec/index.html` with your browser.

With Karma
----------

To compile them,

```
$ . .env
$ build karam
$ open spec/index.html
```

jasmine is used for writing specs.
