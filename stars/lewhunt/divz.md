Divz
====

_A React UI component that lets you scroll, swipe & zoom through HTML elements on the 3D z-axis_

_Click above to try out the demos_

  

Installation
------------

npm install divz

  

Basic Usage
-----------

Import the component and render it in your app or page, wrapping it around your list of divs or other HTML elements:

import { Divz } from "divz";

function App() {
  return (
    <Divz\>
      <div\>1</div\>
      <div\>2</div\>
      <div\>3</div\>
      <div\>4</div\>
    </Divz\>
  );
}

Advanced Usage
--------------

The demos illustrate how the component can be initialised with more props - along with images and videos inside the child divs - for a richer user experience. Demo 3 uses a custom video component with preview images, optimised to only play video when the current item is active:

<Divz
  isExpanded\={true}
  showPlayButton\={false}
  onIndexChange\={(i) \=> setSelectedIndex(i)}
\>
  {demo3Assets.map((item, index) \=> (
    <DivzVideoItem
      key\={index}
      index\={index}
      selectedIndex\={selectedIndex}
      previewImage\={item.image}
      videoSource\={item.video}
    \></DivzVideoItem\>
  ))}
</Divz\>

  

Here's a quick video of Demo 2, utilising dark mode, images and basic video elements:

Why Divz?
---------

Divz was created to quickly showcase portfolio work within a pseudo-3D environment, loosely inspired by Apple's Time Machine interface which allows the user to zoom through historical Finder windows:

What Sets It Apart?
-------------------

-   **Simplified Integration:** Divz is designed to be responsive and easy to use, acting as a straightforward wrapper around a list of divs or other HTML elements.
-   **Diverse Applications:** While the demos showcase its versatility as a carousel, slideshow, or gallery component, Divz opens the door to a range of other potential uses. Consider it an innovative, experimental method for navigating web content.
-   **Broad Device Support:** Divz accommodates various navigation modes, including touch for mobile devices, cursor/trackpad for desktop users, and arrow keys for TV devices.

  

How Does It Work?
-----------------

Under the hood, Divz performs CSS3 transforms on the core component and the child HTML elements, set dynamically with React TypeScript. The component is packaged using Vite to allow npm library integration.
