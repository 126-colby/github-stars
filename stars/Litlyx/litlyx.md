The freshest, developer-friendly analytics tool.  
Litlyx is an open-source, self-hostable analytics solution for modern frameworks. Setup takes less than 30 seconds!

  

Get Started on our Cloud Version
--------------------------------

Sign-up on Litlyx.com and create a project. Then simply use your project\_id to connect Litlyx to your website OR Self-Host Litlyx with Docker.

Universal Installation
----------------------

<script defer data-project\="your\_project\_id" src\="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/litlyx/litlyx-js/browser/litlyx.js"\></script\>

Importing Litlyx with a direct script instantly starts tracking `Page visits`, `Browsers`, `Devices`, `Operating Systems`, `Bouncing Rate`, `Real-Time Online Users`, `Unique Sessions`, `Countries`, and `Average Session Time`.

All Javascript Runtimes
=======================

You can install Litlyx using `npm`, `pnpm`, `yarn` or any modern package managers:

npm i litlyx-js

Litlyx natively works with all JavaScript / TypeScript frameworks. You can use Litlyx in all WordPress Websites by injecting JS code using a plug-in. Litlyx also works in serverless environments with Cloud (or Edge) Functions.

Import
======

Import litlyx-js library into your code:

import { Lit } from 'litlyx-js';

Once imported, you need to initialize Litlyx:

Lit.init('your\_project\_id');

After initialization, Litlyx will automatically track analytics such as `Page visits`, `Browsers`, `Devices`, `Operating Systems`, `Real-Time Online Users`, `Unique Sessions`, `Countries`, and `Average Session Time`.

Track Custom Events
===================

You aren't just limited to the built-in KPIs. With Litlyx, you can create your own events to track in your project.

Lit.event('click\_on\_buy\_item');

If you want more specific tracking, you can use the `metadata` field, like this:

Lit.event('click\_on\_buy\_item', {
  metadata: {
    'product-name': 'Coca-Cola',
    'price': 1.50,
    'currency': 'EUR'
  }
});

Litlyx makes it easy for you to tailor your analytics to your project's needs.

Fire Your First Event with cURL
===============================

Want to quickly see how Litlyx works with events? Use the cURL command below to send a test event. Just replace the `project_id` with your actual project ID in your terminal.

curl -X POST "https://broker.litlyx.com/event" \\
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \\
  -d '{
    "pid": "project\_id",
    "name": "testEvent1",
    "metadata": "{\\"test\\": \\"something\\"}",
    "website": "something",
    "userAgent": "something"
  }'

Self-Hosting with Docker
========================

To self-host the Litlyx dashboard, first **fork** this repository.

Then run the following command:

docker-compose build

after the build finishes, run:

docker-compose up

at localhost:3000 you will see your own instance of the Litlyx Dashboard.

Forward data to your local instance with script tag
---------------------------------------------------

To forward your data on your self-hosted instance, you need to set up the following variables: add your `data-host`, add your `data-port`, and add your `data-secure`, setting it to true if it is HTTPS, and false if it is HTTP.

<script defer data-project\="your\_project\_id" 
        data-host\="your-host-name" 
        data-port\="your-port" 
        data-secure\="true/false"
        src\="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/litlyx/litlyx-js/browser/litlyx.js"\>
</script\>
