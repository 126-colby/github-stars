Compared to Disqus
------------------

Cusdis is not designed to be a complete alternative to Disqus. It's aim is to implement a minimalist and embeddable comment system for small websites (such as your static blog).

Given below are the pros and cons of Cusdis:

### Pros

-   Cusdis is open-source and self-hostable. Hence, you own your data.
-   The SDK is lightweight(~5kb gzipped).
-   Cusdis doesn't require your user to sign in to make a comment.
-   Cusdis doesn't use cookies at all.

### Cons

-   Cusdis is on the early stages of its development.
-   There is no spam filter, hence, you will have to manually moderate your comment section and comments won't be displayed until you approve them.
-   Disqus is a company, we aren't.
