Differences to the Snapdrop it is based on
------------------------------------------

View all differences

### Paired Devices and Public Rooms â€” Internet Transfer

-   Transfer files over the Internet between paired devices or by entering temporary public rooms.
-   Connect to devices in complex network environments (public Wi-Fi, company network, iCloud Private Relay, VPN, etc.).
-   Connect to devices on your mobile hotspot.
-   Devices outside of your local network that are behind a NAT are auto-connected via the PairDrop TURN server.
-   Devices from the local network, in the same public room, or previously paired are shown.

#### Persistent Device Pairing

Always connect to known devices

-   Pair devices via a 6-digit code or a QR-Code.
-   Paired devices always find each other via shared secrets independently of their local network.
-   Pairing is persistent. You find your devices even after reopening PairDrop.
-   You can edit and unpair devices easily.

#### Temporary Public Rooms

Connect to others in complex network situations, or over the Internet.

-   Enter a public room via a 5-letter code or a QR-code.
-   Enter a public room to temporarily connect to devices outside your local network.
-   All devices in the same public room see each other.
-   Public rooms are temporary. Closing PairDrop leaves all rooms.

### Improved UI for Sending/Receiving Files

-   Files are transferred after a request is accepted. Files are auto-downloaded upon completing a transfer, if possible.
-   Multiple files are downloaded as a ZIP file
-   Download, share or save to gallery via the "Share" menu on Android and iOS.
-   Multiple files are transferred at once with an overall progress indicator.

### Send Files or Text Directly From Share Menu, Context Menu or CLI

-   Send files directly from context menu on Ubuntu (using Nautilus)
-   Send files directly from the context menu on Windows
-   Send directly from the "Share" menu on iOS
-   Send directly from the "Share" menu on Android
-   Send directly via the command-line interface
