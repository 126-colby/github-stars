An arctic, north-bluish color palette.

A total of sixteen, carefully selected, dimmed pastel colors for a eye-comfortable, but yet colorful ambiance.

Created for **clear, uncluttered and elegant designs** following a **minimal and flat** style pattern. For syntax highlighting it aims to ensure an **undisturbed focus on important parts of the code**, a **good readability** and a **quick visual distinction** between the different syntax elements.

Nord consists of four named color palettes providing different syntactic meanings and color effects for dark & bright ambiance designs.

All colors are numbered from `nord0` to `nord15` where each palette contains a different amount of colors. The naming convention preserves the compatibility for terminal color schemes and allows an uncomplicated use as base for such.
