Why this theme?
---------------

Hugo Blog Awesome (HBA) is a theme crafted to capture your readers' attention.

Additionally, it's fast, privacy-conscious, and comes with no external dependencies. That's right. There are no Google fonts, icon packs, or JavaScript frameworks. No trackers or ads to bloat your website.

Its focus on minimalism and clean UI ensures that your content takes the spotlight. This, coupled with the support for dark mode, provides a stress-free (on the eyes) reading experience for your audience.

Built with Hugo, SCSS, and vanilla JavaScript.

Setup
-----

> **Note** You must have the Hugo extended version installed in order to use this theme. This theme uses Sass for styling. With the Hugo extended version, Sass can be transpiled to CSS without any additional tools.

### Using the theme as Hugo module

First create a new Hugo site by running the following command:

```
hugo new site myblog
```

Initialize your new Hugo site as hugo module by running the following command:

```
cd myblog
hugo mod init github.com/USER/REPO
```

Afterwards, run this command to add hugo-blog-awesome as module to your site:

```
hugo mod get github.com/hugo-sid/hugo-blog-awesome
```

To make use of the theme, add this module configuration to your site's `hugo.toml`:

```
[module]
  [[module.imports]]
    path = "github.com/hugo-sid/hugo-blog-awesome"
```

To preview the theme with example content, run the following command from the `exampleSite` directory:

```
hugo server
```

### Using the theme as Git submodule

To create a new Hugo site with this theme as Git submodule, run the following command:

```
hugo new site myblog
```

Then, clone this repository into the `themes` directory of your new site:

```
cd myblog
git clone https://github.com/hugo-sid/hugo-blog-awesome.git themes/hugo-blog-awesome
```

To preview the theme with example content, run the following command from the `exampleSite` directory:

```
cd themes/hugo-blog-awesome/exampleSite
hugo server --themesDir ../..
```

To use this theme, set the `theme` variable in your site's `hugo.toml` to `hugo-blog-awesome`:

```
theme = "hugo-blog-awesome"
```

Configuration
-------------

You can take a look at the `hugo.toml` file in the `exampleSite` directory for an example configuration. It is recommended that you copy the `hugo.toml` file from the `exampleSite` directory to the root directory of your Hugo site. You can then edit the `hugo.toml` file to suit your needs.

### Adding favicon

I used realfavicongenerator.net to generate the favicons. You can place the resulting files in the `assets\icons` folder. That should get your favicon working.

If you want to customize anything further, you can modify `layouts\partials\head.html`.

### Adding Social icons

Social icons can be added by configuring `hugo.toml` file in the following manner.

\[\[params.socialIcons\]\]
name = "github"
url = "https://github.com/hugo-sid"

\[\[params.socialIcons\]\]
name = "twitter"
url = "https://twitter.com"

\[\[params.socialIcons\]\]
name = "Rss"
url = "index.xml"
