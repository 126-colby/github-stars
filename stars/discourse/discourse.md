Discourse is the online home for your community. We offer a 100% open source community platform to those who want complete control over how and where their site is run.

Our platform has been battle-tested for over a decade and continues to evolve to meet users’ needs for a powerful community platform. Discourse allows you to create discussion topics and connect using real-time chat, as well as access an ever-growing number of official and community themes. In addition, we offer a wide variety of plugins for features ranging from chatbots powered by Discourse AI to functionalities like SQL analysis using the Data Explorer plugin.

To learn more, visit **discourse.org** and join our support community at meta.discourse.org.
