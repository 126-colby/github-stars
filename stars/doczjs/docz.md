> ‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING

> This is an **OUTDATED** version of Docz, if you are going to use it, be aware that you may possibly find bugs due to the outdated dependencies. Mainly because of all this time without updates, became almost impossible to follow with the decision of keep the same stack and update things.

> So, we're working in a new version that will include an entire core refactoring/rewritting by adding Astro behind the scenes as bundler and another cools feature.

> Since we really want to don't have so much breakings changes - and try to bring back the spot and quality Docz deserves - this can take a while to be done, please be patient and if you want to help, just send me a message on my Twitter!

> Issues related to this old version, also won't be answered, ok? üòÖ

> Thank you üôè

Docz
====

Docz makes it easy to write and publish beautiful interactive documentation for your code. Create MDX files showcasing your code and Docz turns them into a live-reloading, production-ready site.

Why?
----

Documenting code is one of the most important and time-consuming tasks when developing software.

A lot of time is spent on building and maintaining custom documentation sites.

Docz enables you to quickly create a live-reloading, SEO-friendly, production-ready documentation site with MDX and customize the look, feel and behavior when required by leveraging GatsbyJS and Gatsby theme shadowing.

Getting started
---------------

Start by adding `docz` as a dependency to your project with Yarn or npm:

$ yarn add docz # react react-dom

# or

$ npm install docz # react react-dom

> **Note**: `react` and `react-dom` will not be installed automatically. You'll have to install them yourself.

Then, create `.mdx` files anywhere in your project:

\---
name: Button
route: /
\---

import { Playground, Props } from 'docz'
import Button from './Button'

\# Button

<Props of\={Button} />

\## Basic usage

<Playground\>
  <Button type\="submit"\>Click me</Button\>
  <Button\>No, click me</Button\>
</Playground\>

And a Button component `Button.jsx`:

import React from 'react'
import t from 'prop-types'

const Button \= ({ children, type }) \=> <button type\={type}\>{children}</button>

Button.propTypes \= {
  /\*\*
   \* This is a description for this prop.
   \* Button type.
   \*/
  type: t.oneOf(\['button', 'submit', 'reset'\]),
}
Button.defaultProps \= {
  type: 'button',
}
export default Button

Finally, run:

yarn docz dev

This starts a local development server and opens your documentation site in the browser.

Build
-----

`yarn docz build` generates a static site in `.docz/dist/`.

Try it with `yarn docz serve` or by serving the generated site with your favorite static file server (e.g. `npx serve .docz/dist`).

You can have `yarn docz build` emit to a different directory by providing a path to the `dest` field in your `doczrc.js` or from the command line: `yarn docz build --dest docs-site-directory`.

Deploying
---------

The output of docz consists of static assets only. This allows you to deploy your generated `docz` site with any static site hosting provider you'd like.

Start by building your site with `yarn docz build`, if you haven't provided a `dest` flag to your config then you will find your generated files in `.docz/dist` to copy to the server.

Examples
--------

-   **with basic**
-   **with a gatsby site**
-   **with react native**
-   **with styled-components**
-   **with typescript**
-   **with algolia search**
-   **with gatsby-remark-vscode**
-   **with react-router**
-   **with flow**
-   **with images**
-   **with sass**
-   **with less**
-   **with stylus**
-   **with css modules**: works out of the box.
