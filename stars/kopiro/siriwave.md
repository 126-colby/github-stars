SiriWave
========

The "Apple Siri" wave replicated in pure Javascript using the Canvas API. To learn more about the project, read the blog post here, check the demo or codepen.

### iOS (classic) style

The classic, pre-iOS9 style.

### iOS9 style

The new fluorescent wave introduced in iOS9.

### iOS13 style

_work in progress_

The wave reinvented as a bubble.

Usage
-----

### Browser (via CDN) usage

Import the UMD package via the unpkg CDN and it's ready to use.

<script src\="https://unpkg.com/siriwave/dist/siriwave.umd.min.js"\></script\>

### ES module

Install it through `npm install siriwave` or `npm add siriwave` first:

import SiriWave from "siriwave";

Initialize
----------

Create a div container and instantiate a new SiriWave object:

<div id\="siri-container"\></div\>
<script\>
  var siriWave \= new SiriWave({
    container: document.getElementById("siri-container"),
    width: 640,
    height: 200,
  });
</script\>

Constructor options
-------------------

Key

Type

Description

Default

Required

`container`

DOMElement

The DOM container where the DOM canvas element will be added.

null

yes

`style`

"ios", "ios9"

The style of the wave.

"ios"

no

`ratio`

Number

Ratio of the display to use. Calculated by default.

calculated

no

`speed`

Number

The speed of the animation.

0.2

no

`amplitude`

Number

The amplitude of the complete wave-form.

1

no

`frequency`

Number

The frequency of the complete wave-form. Only available in style "ios"

6

no

`color`

String

Color of the wave. Only available in style "ios"

"#fff"

no

`cover`

Bool

The `canvas` covers the entire width or height of the container

false

no

`autostart`

Bool

Decide wether start the animation on boot.

false

no

`pixelDepth`

Number

Number of step (in pixels) used when drawed on canvas.

0.02

no

`lerpSpeed`

Number

Lerp speed to interpolate properties.

0.01

no

`curveDefinition`

ICurveDefinition\[\]

Override definition of the curves, check above for more details.

null

no

`ranges`

IiOS9Ranges

Override the default random ranges of the curves.

null

no

`globalCompositeOperation`

GlobalCompositeOperation

globalCompositeOperation of the canvas, controls wave overlap design.

"lighter"

no

### Ranges

Each wave chooses a random parameter for each of these ranges that factors into their creation. You can override these ranges by passing a `ranges` object to the constructor.

Here is the type of the ranges object:

export type IiOS9Ranges \= {
  noOfCurves?: \[number, number\];
  amplitude?: \[number, number\];
  offset?: \[number, number\];
  width?: \[number, number\];
  speed?: \[number, number\];
  despawnTimeout?: \[number, number\];
};

API
---

#### `new SiriWave`

#### `curveDefinition`

By passing this argument, you're overriding the default curve definition resulting in a completely different style.

The default definition for the `ios` classic style is:

\[
  { attenuation: \-2, lineWidth: 1, opacity: 0.1 },
  { attenuation: \-6, lineWidth: 1, opacity: 0.2 },
  { attenuation: 4, lineWidth: 1, opacity: 0.4 },
  { attenuation: 2, lineWidth: 1, opacity: 0.6 },
  { attenuation: 1, lineWidth: 1.5, opacity: 1 },
\];

and it results in 5 different sin-waves with different parameters and amplitude.

You can set 4 attributes for each curve:

-   `attenuation`: the power factor determining the attenuation
-   `lineWidth`: the line width
-   `opacity`: the opacity
-   `color`: the color, default to `SiriWave.color`; optional

The `ios9` style definition is instead:

\[
  { color: "255,255,255", supportLine: true },
  { color: "15, 82, 169" }, // blue
  { color: "173, 57, 76" }, // red
  { color: "48, 220, 155" }, // green
\];

and it results in 3 different colored waves + 1 support wave that needs to be there.

Here you set:

-   `supportLine`: only one of these curves must have this to `true`, it will be used to draw the support line
-   `color`: the color of the wave

#### `start()`

Start the animation

#### `stop()`

Stop the animation.

#### `setSpeed(newValue)`

Set the new value of speed (animated)

#### `setAmplitude(value)`

Set the new value of amplitude (animated)

#### `dispose()`

Stop the animation and destroy the canvas, by removing it from the DOM. Subsequent `start()` calls on this SiriWave instance will fail with an exception.

Build and development
---------------------

If you wanna make some modifications in your local environment, use:

npm dev

this will create a watchable build with RollupJS and automatically create a server to see your changes in the browser.

To finally build all targets:

npm build
