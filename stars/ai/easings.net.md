Contributing
------------

GitHub has great instructions on how to set up Git, fork a project and make pull requests. If you have a problem with Git, just send your files directly to andrey@sitnik.ru.

### Translate

Just copy the `i18n/en.yml` file to `i18n/CODE.yml` (where `CODE` is the lowercased RFC 3066 language code of your target language, for example `fr-ca` for Canadian French) and translate all messages.

### Test

1.  Install project dependencies:
    
    yarn install
    
2.  Thatâ€™s all. Run development server:
    
    yarn run start
    
3.  And open \[localhost:1234\] in browser.
