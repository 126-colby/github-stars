üåä What is Trench?
------------------

Trench is an event tracking system built on top of Apache Kafka and ClickHouse. It can handle large event volumes and provides real-time analytics. Trench is no-cookie, GDPR, and PECR compliant. Users have full control to access, rectify, or delete their data.

Our team built Trench to scale up the real-time event tracking pipeline at Frigade.

üöÄ Quickstart
-------------

Trench has two methods of deployment:

1.  **Trench Self-Hosted**: An open-source version to deploy and manage Trench on your own infrastructure.
2.  **Trench Cloud**: A fully-managed serverless solution with zero ops, autoscaling, and 99.99% SLAs.

### 1\. Trench Self-Hosted üíª

Follow our self-hosting instructions below and in our quickstart guide to begin using Trench Self-Hosted.

If you have questions or need assistance, you can join our Slack group for support.

#### Quickstart

1.  **Deploy Trench Dev Server**: The only prerequisite for Trench is a system that has Docker and Docker Compose installed see installation guide. We recommend having at least 4GB of RAM and 4 CPU cores for optimal performance if you're running a production environment.
    
    After installing Docker, you can start the local development server by running the following commands:
    
    git clone https://github.com/frigadehq/trench.git
    cd trench/apps/trench
    cp .env.example .env
    docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.dev.yml up --build --force-recreate --renew-anon-volumes
    
    The above command will start the Trench server that includes a local ClickHouse and Kafka instance on `http://localhost:4000`. You can open this URL in your browser and you should see the message `Trench server is running`. You shouldupdate the `.env` file to change any of the configuration options.
    
2.  **Send a sample event**: You can find and update the default public and private API key in the `.env` file. Using your public API key, you can send a sample event to Trench as such:
    
    curl -i -X POST \\
       -H "Authorization:Bearer public-d613be4e-di03-4b02-9058-70aa4j04ff28" \\
       -H "Content-Type:application/json" \\
       -d \\
    '{
      "events": \[
        {
          "userId": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
          "type": "track",
          "event": "ConnectedAccount",
          "properties": {
            "totalAccounts": 4,
            "country": "Denmark"
          },
        }\]
    }' \\
     'http://localhost:4000/events'
    
3.  **Querying events**: You can query events using the `/events` endpoint (see API reference for more details).
    
    You can also query events directly from your local Trench server. For example, to query events of type `ConnectedAccount`, you can use the following URL:
    
    curl -i -X GET \\
       -H "Authorization: Bearer private-d613be4e-di03-4b02-9058-70aa4j04ff28" \\
       'http://localhost:4000/events?event=ConnectedAccount'
    
    This will return a JSON response with the event that was just sent:
    
    {
      "results": \[
        {
          "uuid": "25f7c712-dd86-4db0-89a8-d07d11b73e57",
          "type": "track",
          "event": "ConnectedAccount",
          "userId": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
          "properties": {
            "totalAccounts": 4,
            "country": "Denmark"
          },
          "timestamp": "2024-10-22T19:34:56.000Z",
          "parsedAt": "2024-10-22T19:34:59.530Z"
        }
      \],
      "limit": 1000,
      "offset": 0,
      "total": 1
    }
    
4.  **Execute raw SQL queries**: Use the queries endpoint to analyze your data. Example:
    
    curl -i -X POST \\
       -H "Authorization:Bearer public-d613be4e-di03-4b02-9058-70aa4j04ff28" \\
       -H "Content-Type:application/json" \\
       -d \\
    '{
      "queries": \[
        "SELECT COUNT(\*) FROM events WHERE userId = '550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000'"
      \]
    }' \\
     'http://localhost:4000/queries'
    
    Sample query result:
    
    {
      "results": \[
        {
          "count": 5
        }
      \],
      "limit": 0,
      "offset": 0,
      "total": 1
    }
