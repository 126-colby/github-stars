_Tart_ is a virtualization toolset to build, run and manage macOS and Linux virtual machines (VMs) on Apple Silicon. Built by CI engineers for your automation needs. Here are some highlights of Tart:

-   Tart uses Apple's own `Virtualization.Framework` for near-native performance.
-   Push/Pull virtual machines from any OCI-compatible container registry.
-   Use Tart Packer Plugin to automate VM creation.
-   Easily integrates with any CI system.

Tart powers Cirrus Runners service â€” a drop-in replacement for the standard GitHub-hosted runners, offering 2-3 times better performance for a fraction of the price.

Many companies are using Tart in their internal setups. Here are just a few of them:
