    type: 'bar'
  },
  series: \[
    {
      name: 'sales',
      data: \[30, 40, 35, 50, 49, 60, 70, 91, 125\]
    }
  \],
  xaxis: {
    categories: \[1991, 1992, 1993, 1994, 1995, 1996, 1997, 1998, 1999\]
  }
}

var chart \= new ApexCharts(document.querySelector('#chart'), options)
chart.render()

This will render the following chart

### A little more than the basic

You can create a combination of different charts, sync them and give your desired look with unlimited possibilities. Below is an example of synchronized charts with github style.

Interactivity
-------------

Zoom, Pan, and Scroll through data. Make selections and load other charts using those selections. An example showing some interactivity

Dynamic Series Update
---------------------

Another approach is to Drill down charts where one selection updates the data of other charts. An example of loading dynamic series into charts is shown below

Annotations
-----------

Annotations allow you to write custom text on specific values or on axes values. Valuable to expand the visual appeal of your chart and make it more informative.

Mixed Charts
------------

You can combine more than one chart type to create a combo/mixed chart. Possible combinations can be line/area/column together in a single chart. Each chart type can have its own y-axis.

Candlestick
-----------

Use a candlestick chart (a common financial chart) to describe price changes of a security, derivative, or currency. The below image shows how you can use another chart as a brush/preview pane which acts as a handle to browse the main candlestick chart.

Heatmaps
--------

Use Heatmaps to represent data through colors and shades. Frequently used with bigger data collections, they are valuable for recognizing patterns and areas of focus.

Gauges
------

The tiny gauges are an important part of a dashboard and are useful in displaying single-series data. A demo of these gauges:

Sparklines
----------

Utilize sparklines to indicate trends in data, for example, occasional increments or declines, monetary cycles, or to feature the most extreme and least values:
