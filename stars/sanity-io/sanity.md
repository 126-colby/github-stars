We're always looking to make Sanity Studio more accessible and user-friendly, and your contributions can make a big difference. Whether you're a seasoned developer or just starting out, helping with translations is a fantastic way to get involved.

If you're fluent in a language other than English, we'd love your help in reviewing and improving translations. Your expertise can greatly enhance the experience for users worldwide.

How to Contribute:

1.  Visit our sanity-io/locales repository and try out a locale you are fluent in.
2.  Have ideas for improvements? Submit a PR following the contributing guide.
3.  See if there are open PRs in languages you are fluent in and help review them.

Interested in playing a bigger role? You can ask to be added as a maintainer to oversee translations for specific languages, where you will be automatically added as a reviewer on PRs that involve your language. See the sanity-io/locales README for more.

Your contributions not only improve Sanity Studio but also bring together a diverse and global community of users. We appreciate every effort, big or small, and we can't wait to see what you bring to the table!
