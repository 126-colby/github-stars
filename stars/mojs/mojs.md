mo Â· js â€“
=========

The motion graphics toolbelt for the web.

Intro
-----

**mo Â· js** is a javascript motion graphics library that is a **fast, retina ready, modular and open source**. In comparison to other libraries, it has a different syntax and code animation structure approach. The declarative API provides you a complete control over the animation, making it customizable with ease.

The library provides **built-in components** to start animating from scratch like html, shape, swirl, burst and stagger, but also bring you tools to help craft your animation in a most natural way. Using mojs on your site will enhance the user experience, enrich your content visually and create **delightful animations** precisely.

Install
-------

### Use with a bundler

Mojs is published on the **NPM registry**, so you can install it through the command line interpreter using your favorite package manager. This is the best way to install the library if you are comfortable with **javascript bundlers** like `webpack` or `rollup`.

# npm
npm install @mojs/core

# yarn
yarn add @mojs/core

Then **import it like any other module** inside your build:

import mojs from '@mojs/core';

new mojs.Html({
  // ...
});

> Using a bundler has **many advantages** like output compression, code splitting, tree shaking, etc., so we encourage you to use this kind of tool with mojs.

### Use with a CDN

To rapidly **include the minified production file** in your web page, load the latest build from your favorite CDN using a generic script markup:

<!-- unpkg -->
<script src\="https://unpkg.com/@mojs/core"\></script\>

<!-- jsdelivr -->
<script src\="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@mojs/core"\></script\>

Then instanciate using:

<script\>
  new mojs.Html({
    // ...
  });
</script\>

> By default, if no one is specified, the CDN will automatically target the **@latest** version of mojs and load the **UMD build** from `dist/mo.umd.js`.
