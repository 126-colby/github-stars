Getting Started - Docker Compose
================================

If you simply want to run the full Pezzo stack locally, check out Running With Docker Compose in the documentation.

If you want to run Pezzo in development mode, continue reading.

### Prerequisites

-   Node.js 18+
-   Docker
-   (Recommended) GraphQL Language Feature Support VSCode Extension

### Install dependencies

Install NPM dependencies by running:

```
npm install
```

### Set up the environment files

Pezzo uses a .env file to store environment variables. When using docker, you should also create a .env.docker file.

See the .env.example file for reference.

### Spin up infrastructure dependencies via Docker Compose

Pezzo is entirely cloud-native and relies solely on open-source technologies such as PostgreSQL, ClickHouse, Redis and Supertokens.

You can run these dependencies via Docker Compose:

```
docker-compose -f docker-compose.infra.yaml up
```

### Start Pezzo

Deploy Prisma migrations:

```
npx dotenv-cli -e apps/server/.env -- npx prisma migrate deploy --schema apps/server/prisma/schema.prisma
```

Run the server:

```
npx nx serve server
```

The server is now running. You can verify that by navigating to http://localhost:3000/api/healthz.

In development mode, you want to run `codegen` in watch mode, so whenever you make changes to the schema, types are generated automatically. After running the server, run the following in a _separate terminal Window_:

```
npm run graphql:codegen:watch
```

This will connect codegen directly to the server and keep your GraphQL schema up-to-date as you make changes.

Finally, you are ready to run the Pezzo Console:

```
npx nx serve console
```

That's it! The Pezzo Console is now accessible at http://localhost:4200 üöÄ
