Deployment
----------

This project consists of the main navigation site (`packages/aigotools`) and the inclusion service (`packages/crawler`). It can be deployed via hosting services like Zeabur or directly on a local machine using `docker-compose`.

### Prerequisites

-   Create an application at https://clerk.com/ and add a user to log in as the admin for the management backend.
-   Obtain `OpenAI apiKey` and `jina apiKey`, which are used for site inclusion.
-   Set up MongoDB and Redis databases.

### Local Deployment

1.  Clone the repository:
    
    git clone https://github.com/someu/aigotools.git
    cd aigotools
    
2.  Configure environment variables: Copy the `.env` files in `packages/aigotools` and `packages/crawler` to `.env.prod`.
    
    cp packages/aigotools/.env packages/aigotools/.env.prod
    cp packages/crawler/.env packages/crawler/.env.prod
    
    Modify the configuration files accordingly.
    
3.  Start the project:
    
    docker-compose up -d
    

**Note: If using minio for image storage, you can initially leave the minio authentication configuration empty when starting the project. After running the project, access the minio management backend to create a Bucket, ACCESS\_KEY, and SECRET\_KEY, enable public read permissions for the Bucket, update the configuration file, and restart the project.**
