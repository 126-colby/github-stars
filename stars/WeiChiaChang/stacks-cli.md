stacks-cli
==========

> Check website stack from the terminal.

In fact I know there's already a pretty good Chrome extension called Wappalyzer, but I still wanna make a CLI tool for myself. There's 2 major reasons why:

-   I've already installed too many extensions so far.
-   I'm a CLI lover, it's just that simple.

OMMGGGGGGG

Based on these demands, I started working on fixing these issues.

Install
-------

$ npm install stacks-cli -g

Usage
-----

Type the following command in your terminal:

$ stacks-cli

And the scripts will ask you:

? Which website stack do you wanna browse ?

Copy & Paste the URL of the website you want to analyze:

https://www.cloudflare.com/

Here's a screenshot of the result:
