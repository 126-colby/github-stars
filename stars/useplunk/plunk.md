The Open-Source Email Platform

Introduction

Plunk is an open-source email platform built on top of AWS SES. It allows you to easily send emails from your applications. It can be considered as a self-hosted alternative to services like SendGrid, Resend or Mailgun.

Features
--------

-   **Transactional Emails**: Send emails straight from your API
-   **Automations**: Create automations based on user actions
-   **Broadcasts**: Send newsletters and product updates to big audiences

Self-hosting Plunk
------------------

The easiest way to self-host Plunk is by using the `driaug/plunk` Docker image. You can pull the latest image from Docker Hub.
