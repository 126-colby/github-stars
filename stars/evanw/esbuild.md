Why?
----

Our current build tools for the web are 10-100x slower than they could be:

The main goal of the esbuild bundler project is to bring about a new era of build tool performance, and create an easy-to-use modern bundler along the way.

Major features:

-   Extreme speed without needing a cache
-   JavaScript, CSS, TypeScript, and JSX built-in
-   A straightforward API for CLI, JS, and Go
-   Bundles ESM and CommonJS modules
-   Bundles CSS including CSS modules
-   Tree shaking, minification, and source maps
-   Local server, watch mode, and plugins
