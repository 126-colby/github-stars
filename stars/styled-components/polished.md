A lightweight toolset for writing styles in JavaScript. ‚ú®

npm install --save polished
# or if you're using yarn
yarn add polished

Want to write styles in JavaScript, but also want Sass-style helper functions and mixins? Need a consistent color palette throughout your app? `‚ú® polished` is for you!

-   **Make your app look great without stress**
-   **Cross framework compatible**: No matter if you're using `styled-components`, emotion, jss, aphrodite, radium, or plain inline styles, as long as you're writing your styles in JavaScript you can use polished!
-   **Switching from a pre-processor to styles in JS made easy**

Usage
-----

`‚ú® polished` modules are meant to be used as stand-alone imports. You should avoid importing the entire library directly:

`import { clearFix, animation } from 'polished'` `import * as polished from 'polished` `import polished from 'polished'`

When `‚ú® polished` modules are imported properly, tree shaking in webpack and Rollup can be leveraged to reduce your bundle size.

Browser Support
---------------

All Evergreen Browsers + IE11

As of v3.6.X we support `>0.5%, not dead, ie >= 11, not op_mini all` for all our builds.

Flow Type Definitions
---------------------

`‚ú® polished` has first-class Flow support with zero configuration to assist you in finding type errors while using our modules.

### Ignore ‚ú® polished source

Flow frequently updates and it is possible that the version you are running may cause you to run into errors coming from the `polished` package in your `node_modules` directory. You can add the following lines to your `.flowconfig` to ignore `polished` in those cases:

\[ignore\]
.\*/node\_modules/polished/.\*

TypeScript Definitions
----------------------

`‚ú® polished` has TypeScript definitions to allow the library to be used in any TypeScript project. You will need to set `moduleResolution` to `node` in your `tsconfig.json` in order to use `‚ú® polished` with TypeScript.

### Babel plugin

You can optionally also use `babel-plugin-polished` to compile the static function calls out and remove the (already tiny) runtime performance impact of using `‚ú® polished`.

### Object Spread Properties

In the documentation you will see examples using object spread properties (`{ ...other }`). To enable this syntax in your project add the `transform-object-rest-spread` plugin (or the `stage-3` preset to enable all stage three features) to your Babel configuration.

Why?
----

When writing styles in JavaScript, many people need Sass-style helper functions to be productive. `‚ú® polished` brings them to you in a nice, lightweight package tailor-made for styles in JavaScript.

The main difference with Sass is that it's written in a functional style and all color functions are curried. This means you can compose them together into your own reusable helpers with a `compose` function of your choice:

import { compose } from 'ramda' // Replace with any compose() function of your choice
import { lighten, desaturate } from 'polished'

// Create tone() helper
const tone \= compose(lighten(0.1), desaturate(0.1))

### Why not `package-xyz`?

First of all, we didn't find another library that had everything we needed, and we don't care about installing a dozen packages separately.

Specifically most other packages that provide color functions do so in an object-oriented style, often with a fluent API that's very different from the Sass-style helpers. This means people that aren't very familiar with JavaScript might shy away from using them.

`‚ú® polished` was made as a standard library for everybody, no matter if they know JS inside out or not.

Compatibility
-------------

‚ú® polished is **compatible with any library that accepts styles as JS objects**. This includes, but is by far not limited to, `styled-components`, radium, aphrodite, glamor, glamorous, jss and many more!

No matter if you're using inline styles or CSS-in-JS, polished is for you.
