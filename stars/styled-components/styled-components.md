**Visual primitives for the component age. Use the best bits of ES6 and CSS to style your apps without stress üíÖ**  
  

* * *

**Upgrading from v5?** See the migration guide.

Utilizing tagged template literals (a recent addition to JavaScript) and the power of CSS, `styled-components` allow you to write actual CSS code to style your components. It also removes the mapping between components and styles ‚Äì using components as a low-level styling construct could not be easier!

const Button \= styled.button\`
  color: grey;
\`;

Alternatively, you may use style objects. This allows for easy porting of CSS from inline styles, while still supporting the more advanced styled-components capabilities like component selectors and media queries.

const Button \= styled.button({
  color: 'grey',
});

Equivalent to:

const Button \= styled.button\`
  color: grey;
\`;

`styled-components` is compatible with both React (for web) and React Native ‚Äì meaning it's the perfect choice even for truly universal apps! See the documentation about React Native for more information.

_Supported by Front End Center. Thank you for making this possible!_

Example

import React from 'react';

import styled from 'styled-components';

// Create a <Title> react component that renders an <h1> which is
// centered, palevioletred and sized at 1.5em
const Title \= styled.h1\`
  font-size: 1.5em;
  text-align: center;
  color: palevioletred;
\`;

// Create a <Wrapper> react component that renders a <section> with
// some padding and a papayawhip background
const Wrapper \= styled.section\`
  padding: 4em;
  background: papayawhip;
\`;

function MyUI() {
  return (
    // Use them like any other React component ‚Äì except they're styled!
    <Wrapper\>
      <Title\>Hello World, this is my first styled component!</Title\>
    </Wrapper\>
  );
}
