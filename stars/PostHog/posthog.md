PostHog is an all-in-one, open source platform for building better products
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

-   Specify events manually, or use autocapture to get started quickly
-   Analyze data with ready-made visualizations, or do it yourself with SQL
-   Track website visitors separately with our GA4 alternative
-   Only capture properties on the people you want to track, save money when you don't
-   Gather insights by capturing session replays, console logs, and network monitoring
-   Improve your product with Experiments that automatically analyze performance
-   Safely roll out features to select users or cohorts with feature flags
-   Send out fully customizable surveys to specific cohorts of users
-   Connect to external services and manage data flows with PostHog CDP

PostHog is available with hosting in the EU or US and is SOC 2 Type 2 compliant. It's free to get started and comes with a generous monthly free tier.

We're constantly adding new features, and recently launched web analytics and a data warehouse!

Get started for free
--------------------

### PostHog Cloud (Recommended)

The fastest and most reliable way to get started with PostHog is signing up for free toÂ PostHog Cloud or PostHog Cloud EU. Your first 1 million events (and 5k replays) are free every month, after which you pay based on usage.

### Open-source hobby deploy (Advanced)

You can deploy a hobby instance in one line on Linux with Docker (recommended 4GB memory):

 /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/posthog/posthog/HEAD/bin/deploy-hobby)" 

Open source deployments should scale to approximately 100k events per month, after which we recommend migrating to a PostHog Cloud instance. See our docs for more info and limitations. Please note that we do not provide customer support for open source deployments.

PostHog brings all the tools and data you need to build better products.

### Analytics and optimization tools

-   **Event-based analytics:** Capture your product's usage automatically, or customize it to your needs
-   **User and group tracking:** Understand the people and groups behind the events and track properties about them when needed
-   **Data visualizations:** Create and share graphs, funnels, paths, retention, and dashboards
-   **SQL access:** Use SQL to get a deeper understanding of your users, breakdown information and create completely tailored visualizations
-   **Session replays:** Watch videos of your users' behavior, with fine-grained filters and privacy controls, as well as network monitoring and captured console logs
-   **Heatmaps:** See where users click and get a visual representation of their behaviour with the PostHog Toolbar
-   **Feature flags:** Test and manage the rollout of new features to specific users and groups, or deploy flags as kill-switches
-   **Experiments:** run simple or complex changes as experiments and get automatic significance calculations
-   **Correlation analysis:** Discover what events and properties correlate with success and failure
-   **Surveys:** Collect qualitative feedback from your users using fully customizable surveys

### Data and infrastructure tools

-   **Import and export your data:** Import from and export to the services that matter to you with the PostHog CDP
-   **Ready-made libraries:** Weâ€™ve built libraries for JavaScript, Python, Ruby, Node, Go, Android, iOS, PHP, Flutter, React Native, Elixir, Nim, and an API for anything else
-   **Plays nicely with data warehouses:** import events or user data from your warehouse by writing a simple transformation plugin, and export data with pre-built apps - such as BigQuery, Redshift, Snowflake, and S3
