üì¶ Installation
---------------

To add the icons to your project, run one of the following commands:

npm i developer-icons

or

yarn add developer-icons

or

pnpm add developer-icons

‚öôÔ∏è Usage
--------

Import named icon components from the `developer-icons` package and use them just like any other React component, with props/attributes similar to those of an SVG:

import { HtmlIcon, JavascriptIcon } from "developer-icons";

//inside your React component JSX
export const YourReactComponent \= () \=> {
  return (
    <div\>
      <HtmlIcon className\="html-icon" />
      <JavascriptIcon size\={52} style\={{ marginLeft: 20 }} />
    </div\>
  );
};

In this example, we import `HtmlIcon` and `JavascriptIcon` from the `developer-icons` package and use them within a React component. You can customize the icons by adjusting their `size`, `color`, `style`, and other properties.
