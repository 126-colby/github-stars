Clean and modern look
---------------------

Zefyr's rich text editor is built with simplicity and flexibility in mind. It provides clean interface for distraction-free editing. Think Medium.com-like experience.

Markdown-inspired semantics
---------------------------

Ever needed to have a heading line inside of a quote block, like in this Markdown block:

> ### I'm a Markdown heading
> 
> And I'm a regular paragraph

Zefyr can deliver exactly that:

Ready for collaborative editing
-------------------------------

Zefyr's document model uses data format compatible with Operational Transformation which makes it possible to use for collaborative editing use cases or whenever there is a need for conflict-free resolution of changes.

> Zefyr editor uses Quill.js **Delta** as underlying data format. Read more about Zefyr and Deltas in our documentation. Make sure to checkout official documentation for Delta format as well.
