Checkmate
=========

**An open source server and infrastructure monitoring application**

Checkmate is an open source monitoring tool used to track the operational status and performance of servers and websites. It regularly checks whether a server/website is accessible and performs optimally, providing real-time alerts and reports on the monitored services' availability, downtime, and response time.

Checkmate also has an agent, called Capture, to retrieve data from remote servers. While Capture is not required to run Checkmate, it provides additional insigths about your servers' CPU, RAM, disk and temperature status.

Checkmate has ben stress tested with 1000+ active monitors without any particular issues or performance bottlenecks.

We **love** what we are building here, and we contibuously learn a few things about Reactjs, Nodejs, MongoDB and Docker while building Checkmate.

üì¶ Demo
-------

See Checkmate in action. The username is uptimedemo@demo.com and the password is Demouser1! (just a note that we update the demo server from time to time, so if it doesn't work for you, please ping us on Discussions channel).

üîó User's guide
---------------

Usage instructions can be found here. It's still WIP and some of the information there might be outdated. Rest assured, we are doing our best! :)

üõ†Ô∏è Installation
----------------

See installation instructions in Checkmate documentation portal. Alternatively, you can also use Coolify for a one click Docker deployment. If you would like to monitor your server infrastructure, you'll need Capture agent. Capture repository also contains the installation instructions.
