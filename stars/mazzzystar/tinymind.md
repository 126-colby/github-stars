How It Works
------------

1.  You authorize Tinymind to read/write your public GitHub repositories.
2.  Tinymind immediately creates a public repository named `tinymind-blog` in your GitHub account.
3.  When you write anything on Tinymind, it automatically commits to your `yourname/tinymind-blog` repository.

Your data is stored on your GitHub repository, separate from Tinymind.

Data Privacy & Permissions

Your data remains secure:

-   Stored directly in your GitHub repository
-   Only write access to public repositories
-   Full control via your GitHub account
