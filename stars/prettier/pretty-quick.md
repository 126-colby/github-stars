Pre-Commit Hook
---------------

You can run `pretty-quick` as a `pre-commit` hook using `simple-git-hooks`.

# npm
npm install -D simple-git-hooks

# yarn
yarn add -D simple-git-hooks

In `package.json`, add:

"simple-git-hooks": {
  "pre-commit": "yarn pretty-quick --staged" // or "npx pretty-quick --staged"
}

CLI Flags
---------

### `--staged` (only git)

Pre-commit mode. Under this flag only staged files will be formatted, and they will be re-staged after formatting.

Partially staged files will not be re-staged after formatting and pretty-quick will exit with a non-zero exit code. The intent is to abort the git commit and allow the user to amend their selective staging to include formatting fixes.

### `--no-restage` (only git)

Use with the `--staged` flag to skip re-staging files after formatting.

### `--branch`

When not in `staged` pre-commit mode, use this flag to compare changes with the specified branch. Defaults to `master` (git) / `default` (hg) branch.

### `--pattern`

Filters the files for the given minimatch pattern. For example `pretty-quick --pattern "**/*.*(js|jsx)"` or `pretty-quick --pattern "**/*.js" --pattern "**/*.jsx"`

### `--verbose`

Outputs the name of each file right before it is processed. This can be useful if Prettier throws an error and you can't identify which file is causing the problem.

### `--bail`

Prevent `git commit` if any files are fixed.

### `--check`

Check that files are correctly formatted, but don't format them. This is useful on CI to verify that all changed files in the current branch were correctly formatted.

### `--no-resolve-config`

Do not resolve prettier config when determining which files to format, just use standard set of supported file types & extensions prettier supports. This may be useful if you do not need any customization and see performance issues.

By default, pretty-quick will check your prettier configuration file for any overrides you define to support formatting of additional file extensions.

Example `.prettierrc` file to support formatting files with `.cmp` or `.page` extensions as html.

{
  "printWidth": 120,
  "bracketSpacing": false,
  "overrides": \[
    {
      "files": "\*.{cmp,page}",
      "options": { "parser": "html" }
    }
  \]
}

### `--ignore-path`

Check an alternative file for ignoring files with the same format as `.prettierignore`. For example `pretty-quick --ignore-path .gitignore`

Configuration and Ignore Files
------------------------------

`pretty-quick` will respect your `.prettierrc`, `.prettierignore`, and `.editorconfig` files if you don't use `--ignore-path` . Configuration files will be found by searching up the file system. `.prettierignore` files are only found from the repository root and the working directory that the command was executed from.
