Awesome Cloudflare Workers
==========================

A curated list of awesome articles & code for **Cloudflare Workers**. They are similar to\* browsers' Service Workers, running in a modified Chromium 'tab', but in the cloud--flare.

Inspired by the awesome list. (A bit different, since the CSV bookmark dump contains _many_ other links that didn't make the 'awesome' list.)

The "Emergency-management" links are for projects that help out with COVID-19 and other emgerinces. "Boss" links are top examples to help convince others (namely your boss or CTO).

Please use the Link Suggestion Form to add an URL to this list. To fix something, suggest a new catgory, tag, etc, reach me on Twitter.
