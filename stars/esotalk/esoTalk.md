esoTalk – Fat-free forum software
---------------------------------

**Help develop _Flarum_, esoTalk's successor. Flarum on GitHub »**

esoTalk is a free, open-source forum software package built with PHP and MySQL. It is designed to be:

-   **Fast.** esoTalk's code was architectured to have little overhead and to be as efficient as possible.
-   **Simple.** All of esoTalk's interfaces are designed around simplicity, ease-of-use, and speed.
-   **Powerful.** Despite its simplicity, a large array of plugins and skins are available to extend the functionality of esoTalk.

esoTalk is developed by Toby Zerner in memory of his brother, Simon.

### System Requirements

esoTalk requires **PHP 5.3+** and a modern version of **MySQL**.

The PHP **gd extension** is required to support avatar uploading.

esoTalk has only been tested on **Apache** and **lighttpd**. If you encounter a problem specific to any other web server, please create an issue.

### Installation

1.  Download esoTalk.
2.  Extract and upload the files to your PHP-enabled web server.

### Upgrading

To upgrade esoTalk from an older version, simply:
