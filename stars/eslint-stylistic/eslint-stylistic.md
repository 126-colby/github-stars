ESLint Stylistic
================

Documentation | Discord | Why | Migration | Project Progress

Community-maintained stylistic/formatting ESLint rules for JavaScript and TypeScript.

This project was initiated as ESLint and `typescript-eslint` teams decided to deprecate formatting/stylistic-related rules from their core due to the maintenance cost. This repo ports those rules and distributes them as separate packages and will keep them maintained by the community.
