emoji-regex-xs
==============

This is a drop-in replacement for the `emoji-regex` package that shares its API and passes all of its emoji tests, but reduces its uncompressed size by more than 97% (from ~13 KB to 0.3 KB).

Install and use
---------------

Via npm:

npm install emoji-regex-xs

In Node.js:  
(This is copied from `emoji-regex` to show that it works the same.)

const emojiRegex \= require('emoji-regex-xs');
// Or: import emojiRegex from 'emoji-regex-xs';

// Note: because the regular expression has the global flag set, this module
// exports a function that returns the regex rather than exporting the regular
// expression itself, to make it impossible to (accidentally) mutate the
// original regular expression.

const text \= \`
\\u{231A}: ‚åö default emoji presentation character (Emoji\_Presentation)
\\u{2194}\\u{FE0F}: ‚ÜîÔ∏è default text presentation character rendered as emoji
\\u{1F469}: üë© emoji modifier base (Emoji\_Modifier\_Base)
\\u{1F469}\\u{1F3FF}: üë©üèø emoji modifier base followed by a modifier
\`;

const regex \= emojiRegex();
for (const match of text.matchAll(regex)) {
  const emoji \= match\[0\];
  console.log(\`Matched sequence ${emoji} ‚Äî code points: ${\[...emoji\].length}\`);
}

Console output:

Matched sequence ‚åö ‚Äî code points: 1
Matched sequence ‚åö ‚Äî code points: 1
Matched sequence ‚ÜîÔ∏è ‚Äî code points: 2
Matched sequence ‚ÜîÔ∏è ‚Äî code points: 2
Matched sequence üë© ‚Äî code points: 1
Matched sequence üë© ‚Äî code points: 1
Matched sequence üë©üèø ‚Äî code points: 2
Matched sequence üë©üèø ‚Äî code points: 2

**Compatibility**

‚Ä¢ Node.js 4  
‚Ä¢ 2015-era browsers

‚Ä¢ Node.js 10  
‚Ä¢ 2016-era browsers

**Uncompressed size**

~13 KB

~0.3 KB

**Gzipped size**

~3 KB

~0.3 KB

**Unicode version**

Uses the latest Unicode version at the time of release, so results are deterministic.

Uses the Unicode version that your browser or environment supports natively, so results match the handling of other functionality.

**Excludes non-emoji symbols, dingbats, etc.**

Yes.

Yes.

**Matches everything matched by ES2024's `/\p{RGI_Emoji}/v`**

Yes.

Yes.

**Matches additional non-RGI emoji**

Yes. Allows overqualified and underqualified emoji using an explicitly-defined list (Unicode's emoji-test.txt strings, which includes non-RGI emoji) plus an additional list of exceptions.

Yes. Allows overqualified and underqualified emoji using a general pattern that matches all Unicode sequences that follow the structure of valid emoji. This allows it to match emoji supported on only some platforms (ex: women wrestling: light skin and Texas flag) that aren't correctly matched by `emoji-regex`. Results are therefore more complete, but note that they can include emoji code point sequences that don't correspond to currently-used emoji.

More details about emoji, Unicode properties, and regexes
---------------------------------------------------------

Emoji are complicated. Or more specifically, how they're defined in the Unicode Standard is complicated. So writing a regex that matches all/only emoji is also complicated. For starters, individual emoji can be made up of between one and _many_ Unicode code points, and there are a variety of different sequence patterns. There are also a variety of Unicode symbols, dingbats, etc. that are not emoji, that we don't want to match.

Given the complexity, many libraries that roll their own emoji regex get it very wrong, e.g. by matching emoji fragments that split off some of their attributes, or by matching things like digits (0, 1, 2, ‚Ä¶), #, \*, or certain invisible characters. These characters are obviously not emoji, but they're matched by naive patterns because they might _become_ emoji when followed by various combining characters. Or they might be special characters used in emoji sequences while not being emoji on their own.

ES2018 added support for matching Unicode properties in regular expressions with `\p{‚Ä¶}`, so you might think this problem is now trivial, given that the list of supported properties includes `Emoji`, `Emoji_Presentation`, `Emoji_Modifier`, `Emoji_Modifier_Base`, `Emoji_Component`, and `Extended_Pictographic`. But no. On their own, none of these are what you want.

ES2024 added support for matching multicharacter Unicode _properties of strings_ with `\p{‚Ä¶}`, so you might think one of the new properties `Basic_Emoji`, `Emoji_Keycap_Sequence`, `RGI_Emoji_Modifier_Sequence`, `RGI_Emoji_Flag_Sequence`, `RGI_Emoji_Tag_Sequence`, `RGI_Emoji_ZWJ_Sequence`, or `RGI_Emoji` will do the trick. Well, kind of. `RGI_Emoji` indeed seems like what we want, but unfortunately, some common-sense and broadly-supported emoji are not officially in the "RGI" (Recommended for General Interchange) list. And even more frustratingly, some emoji are commonly used in an underqualified or overqualified way (by including or excluding certain invisible Unicode markers) that prevents them from being matched by `RGI_Emoji`. For example, the iOS emoji keyboard overqualifies certain emoji. So we need something that matches everything in `RGI_Emoji`, and more. Additionally, `\p{RGI_Emoji}` relies on flag `v` which is only supported by 2023-era browsers and Node.js 20+.

All of this is why the popular `emoji-regex` package exists. It does a great job of accurately matching most common-sense emoji. But to do so, it uses a massive (~13 KB uncompressed) regex that hard codes a list of Unicode code points that are tied to a specific Unicode version. Conversely, `emoji-regex-xs` uses a general pattern that continues to be highly accurate in matching all/only emoji, but uses only ~0.3 KB to do so. It follows `emoji-regex`'s API and reuses its tests, so it can be swapped-in as a replacement.
