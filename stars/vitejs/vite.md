> Next Generation Frontend Tooling

-   💡 Instant Server Start
-   ⚡️ Lightning Fast HMR
-   🛠️ Rich Features
-   📦 Optimized Build
-   🔩 Universal Plugin Interface
-   🔑 Fully Typed APIs

Vite (French word for "quick", pronounced `/vit/`, like "veet") is a new breed of frontend build tooling that significantly improves the frontend development experience. It consists of two major parts:

-   A dev server that serves your source files over native ES modules, with rich built-in features and astonishingly fast Hot Module Replacement (HMR).
    
-   A build command that bundles your code with Rollup, pre-configured to output highly optimized static assets for production.
    

In addition, Vite is highly extensible via its Plugin API and JavaScript API with full typing support.
