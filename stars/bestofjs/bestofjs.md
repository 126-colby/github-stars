Best of JS monorepo
===================

Monorepo for _Best of JS_ application. Made of four applications and two package:

├── apps
│   ├── admin
│   ├── backend
│   ├── bestofjs-nextjs
│   └── bestofjs-webui
└── packages
    ├── api
    └── db

Concept
-------

Best of JS gathers the latest trends about open source projects related to the web platform and Node.js: JavaScript and TypeScript of course (client and server side) but also HTML, CSS, languages that compile to JavaScript, alternative runtimes such as Deno and Bun...

This is a place where full-stack developers can find the best components to build amazing web applications.

Tags
----

Projects are carefully classified under tags such as:

-   Component Toolkits: Sets of UI components for your favorite framework
-   UI frameworks: solutions to build front-end applications that run in the browser: React, Vue.js, Angular...
-   Node.js frameworks: solutions to build server-side applications with Node.js: Express, Nest, Fastify...
-   Charting: data visualization and chart libraries: D3, ChartJS, ECharts...
-   And many more!

Community-driven
----------------

If you find an interesting project to add, you can suggest it by creating an issue here.

You can sign-in with your GitHub account to bookmark the projects you want to follow closely.

How it works
------------

We maintain a list of interesting projects related to Node.js and the web platform in a database.

Everyday a scheduled task checks project data from GitHub and generates data consumed by the web application. Basically _Best of JS_ tracks the number of stars of a curated list of about 2000 projects.

The web application displays the variations over the last days, weeks and months in order to show the trends about the JavaScript landscape.
