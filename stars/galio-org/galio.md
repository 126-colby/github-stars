Reporting Issues
----------------

We use GitHub Issues as the official bug tracker for Galio. Here are some advices for our users that want to report an issue:

1.  Make sure that you are using the latest version of Galio. Check for your fork's master branch status and see if it's up to date with the upstream/master (our repository)
2.  Provide us with reproducible steps for the issue.
3.  Some issues may be platform specific, so specifying what platform and if it's a simulator or a hardware device will help a lot.
