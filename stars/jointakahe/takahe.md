A _beta_ Fediverse server for microblogging. Not fully polished yet - we're still working towards a 1.0!

**Current version: 0.11.0**

Key features:

-   **Multiple domain support**, allowing you to host as many domains as you like on a single running instance.
-   **Multiple identity support**, allowing users to represent themselves in as many different ways as they want.
-   **Easy deployment and maintenance**, so you can focus on looking after your community rather than trying to wrangle with the software.
-   **Mastodon Client API compatible**, so users can use their favourite client apps just as they would with Mastodon or other compatible servers.
