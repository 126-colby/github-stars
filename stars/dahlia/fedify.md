Fedify: an ActivityPub server framework
=======================================

Note

Looking for a quick demo? Here it is: Fedify Demo on Deno Playground.

Fedify is a TypeScript library for building federated server apps powered by ActivityPub and other standards, so-called fediverse.1 It aims to eliminate the complexity and redundant boilerplate code when building a federated server app, so that you can focus on your business logic and user experience.

Currently, Fedify provides the following features out of the box:

-   Type-safe objects for Activity Vocabulary (including some vendor-specific extensions)
-   WebFinger client and server
-   HTTP Signatures
-   Object Integrity Proofs & Linked Data Signatures
-   Middlewares for handling webhooks
-   NodeInfo protocol
-   Special touch for interoperability with Mastodon and few other popular fediverse software
-   Integration with various web frameworks
-   CLI toolchain for testing and debugging

If you want to know more about the project, please take a look at the following resources:

-   Installation

-   API reference
-   Examples

If you have any questions, suggestions, or feedback, please feel free to join our Matrix chat space or Discord server or GitHub Discussions. Or tag #Fedify in the fediverse!
