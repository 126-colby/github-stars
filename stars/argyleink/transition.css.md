**46 pre-built transitions!**

> Hands on at Codepen or preview all @ transition.style

  
  

Basics
------

Import the CSS and set an attribute on some HTML: try on Codepen  

<link rel\="stylesheet" href\="https://unpkg.com/transition-style"\>

<div transition-style\="in:wipe:up"\>
  üëç
</div\>

  
  

Installation
------------

#### NPM

1.  `npm i transition-style`
2.  import from **CSS**

@import "transition-style";

1.  or import from **JS**

import 'transition-style';

#### CDN

`https://unpkg.com/transition-style`

  

**Individual Category Bundles**

-   **Circles** `https://unpkg.com/transition-style/transition.circles.min.css`
-   **Squares** `https://unpkg.com/transition-style/transition.squares.min.css`
-   **Polygons** `https://unpkg.com/transition-style/transition.polygons.min.css`
-   **Wipes** `https://unpkg.com/transition-style/transition.wipes.min.css`

> Import category bundles from NPM too `import "transition-style/transition.circles.min.css"`

  

### üëâ The Hackpack

`https://unpkg.com/transition-style/transition.hackpack.min.css`

**More options, more control, smaller import**  
by importing only the custom properties and base styles:

-   compose custom transition combinations
-   create multi-part transitions
-   bring your own architecture with classes or CSS-in-JS or anything!

The Hackpack Sandbox

> Custom properties ship with each `.min.css` as well

  

### üîó Bookmarklet

Try transition.css on almost any _existing_ site! Just copy üìã the following, create a new bookmark, and paste in the URL:

javascript:(function(){var a\=document.createElement("link");a.rel\="stylesheet";a.href\="https://unpkg.com/transition-style";document.head.append(a);})();

You can now go to a website and click the bookmark to try it out! Animations automatically run when you manually add classes in dev tools, or run code like this in the console:

$('body').setAttribute('transition-style','in:circle:bottom-right')

Caveat: this bookmarklet doesn't work on websites that have a strict CSP set up.

  

  
  

Usage
-----

After `transition.css` has been added to your project, add an attribute to an element and watch the magic:

<div transition-style\="in:circle:bottom-right"\>
  A transitioned IN element
</div\>

<div transition-style\="out:wipe:down"\>
  A transitioned OUT element
</div\>

> if nothing is happening when using the attributes, it's likely `transition.css` has not loaded

  
Attributes were chosen as the default so there's no question which transition is active. \*\*There can be only 1 at a time.\*\* With classes, for example, what happens when multiple "transition in" classes are applied to an element? Transition.css chooses to default with a state machine approach so things like a classname collision doesn't need solved. See the \[custom\](#custom) section below for ways to use classes and/or the shape custom properties so transition.css can fit into your development environment. The built in attribute based approach is very easy to hack, customize and escape.

#### Using `@keyframes`

Each bundle ships with the `@keyframes` declared, and you can use them as you see fit. You can use these to build your own animations or just hook into the presets in your own way:

.main--state-in {
  animation: wipe-in-left;
  animation-duration: 2s;
  animation-fill-mode: both;
}

Checkout the src to find the names of the `@keyframe` animations. They follow a pattern like the attributes, so you should be able to assume what they are with decent accuracy.

  

#### Using CSS Custom Properties

Each bundle ships with clearly named custom properties which contain the state and geometry needed to orchestrate custom transitions.

.overrides {
  \--transition\_\_duration: 1s;            /\* default: 2.5s \*/
  \--transition\_\_easing: ease-in-out;     /\* default: cubic-bezier(.25, 1, .30, 1) \*/
  \--transition\_\_delay: 1s;               /\* default: 0 \*/
}

or target a specific transition and override it's defaults:

\[transition\="in:wipe:up"\] {
  \--transition\_\_duration: 1s;
}

  

#### Custom

Go off the rails and build your own transitions with these variables. There's even the `The Hackpack` which is exclusively the custom props ü§òüíÄ Here's how you can compose a brand new transition from the custom property primitives:

@keyframes circle-swoop {
  from {
    clip-path: var(\--circle-top-right-out);
  }
  to {
    clip-path: var(\--circle-bottom-right-in);
  }
}

.\--in-custom {
  \--transition\_\_duration: 1s;
  \--transition\_\_easing: ease-in-out;
  animation-name: circle-swoop;
}

Then, in the HTML:

<div transition-style class\="\--in-custom"\>
  A custom transitioned element
</div\>

> The only rule is that you must transition from the same type of shapes

At this point you're using Transition.css to it's maximum. You can reach a huge set of transitions by using the custom properties. Have fun!
