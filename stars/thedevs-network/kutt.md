Setup

### Manual

You need to have Node.js, PostgreSQL and Redis installed.

1.  Clone this repository or download the latest zip.
2.  Copy `.example.env` to `.env` and fill it properly (see below).
3.  Install dependencies: `npm install`.
4.  Run for development: `npm run dev`.
5.  Run for production: `npm run build` then `npm start`.

### Docker

1.  Download the `docker-compose.yml` and the `.docker.env` files.
2.  Rename `.docker.env` to `.env` and fill it properly (see below).
3.  To execute Kutt you simply have to run `docker-compose up -d` command and then the app should be ready on port "3000".

The `docker-compose.yml` uses the official kutt docker image available on Docker Hub.

### Configuration

For the minimal configuration the following settings have to be changed in the `.env`\-file:

-   **DEFAULT\_DOMAIN**: The domain of your kutt instance
-   **DB\_**: The DB credentials (when you use docker-compose you can skip these)
-   **ADMIN\_EMAILS**: A comma-separated list of the administrator-accounts
-   **RECAPTCHA\_**: Enter your credentials to use reCaptchas or delete this setting if you don't want to use it
-   **MAIL\_**: Enter the SMTP-server's credentials (The experience shows SSL works better than STARTTLS; The mail config is required to easily create accounts, see this comment how it can be done manually)
-   **REPORT\_EMAIL**: Kutt offers a form to report malicious links which are sent to this mail-address
